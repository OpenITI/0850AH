   NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Two first-level headers added for the introduction and the beginning of the biographical entries. 2- The small differences reported by the annotator is most probably because the digital version is printed in 1973 while the PDF is printed in 1980 by the same publisher. Although the 1980 version seems to be a reprint, my guess is that it is a newer edition since 1980 version has “al-ṭabʿŧ al-ūlá” on the cover page. Unfortunately, 1973 edition is not accessible online and I can’t verify this (see http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/4771213466).
