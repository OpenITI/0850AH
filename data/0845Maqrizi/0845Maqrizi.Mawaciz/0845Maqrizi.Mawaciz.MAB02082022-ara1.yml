90#VERS#COMMENT##: Good correspondence, no obvious errors. Occasionally
    automatically generated (?) titles separated the preposition bi- from
    its object. MAB - Collated with Furqan addition to add more granular subheadings for analysis (but there are differences between these texts - which I have not corrected for), deleted editorial intro. Original URI - for corresponding passim runs: 0845Maqrizi.Mawaciz.Shamela0011566-ara1, heading text that is not present in the original text (as it appears in the Shamela version) has been added between square brackets "[" "]"
