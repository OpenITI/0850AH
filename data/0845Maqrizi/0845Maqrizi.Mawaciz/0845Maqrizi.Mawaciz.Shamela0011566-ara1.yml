90#VERS#COMMENT##: Good correspondence, no obvious errors. Occasionally
    automatically generated (?) titles separated the preposition bi- from
    its object.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): PARATEXT added. I corrected the levelling of the
    headers based on what I can understand from the titles. However, levelling the
    headers is difficult in this text. Headers must be added by the specialist who
    will read the text closely.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
