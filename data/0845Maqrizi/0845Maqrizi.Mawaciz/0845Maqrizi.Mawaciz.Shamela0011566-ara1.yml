90#VERS#COMMENT##: Good correspondence, no obvious errors. Occasionally
    automatically generated (?) titles separated the preposition bi- from
    its object.
   NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): PARATEXT added. I corrected the levelling of the headers based on what I can understand from the titles. However, levelling the headers is difficult in this text. Headers must be added by the specialist who will read the text closely.
