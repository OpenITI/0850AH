90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: the name of the annotator (latin characters; please
    use consistently)
90#VERS#COMMENT##: the text was tagged before; no proper YML file yet.
    See, `README.md` for details.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Changes in the levelling of the headers made. 2- The obituaries do not have numbers and I tagged them using a lot of RegEx patterns. A few cases might be missing or redundant. 3- The
    annotator reports more than 15 missing titles and some other missing sentences,
    without mentioning their places in the text. I typed three missing titles that I
    found. There might be more cases. I also see quite a lot of incomplete sentences. Some of them aer incomplete in the PDF and are not a problem in the digital version, but some others are missing just in the digital text. The text is probably typed a little carelessly.
    All paratextual elements
