90#VERS#COMMENT##: Good correspondence overall; no obvious errors. The
    autotagging was erroneous in many places. Occasionally pages are out by
    a couple of lines; this is usually when a paragraph runs onto the next
    page by only a couple of lines, and it has been kept together on one
    page.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Some changes made in the heads and their levelling.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
