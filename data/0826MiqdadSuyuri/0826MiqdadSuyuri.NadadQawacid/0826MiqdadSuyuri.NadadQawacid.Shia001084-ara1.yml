90#VERS#COMMENT##: Very close correspondence to printed edition.
    Removed editorial sections and footnotes.
    Qāʿidas are introduced by: :(القاعدة) الثانية.
    The qāʿidas then follow on the next line but aren't
    clearly differentiated from the text that follows.
    Late in the book the qāʿidas are sometimes introduced merely by an ordinal
    number.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
